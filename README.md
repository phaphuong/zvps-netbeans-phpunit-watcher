Netbeans PHPUnit Watcher
=============================

PHPUnit Watcher is a small light weight plugin to assist PHP developers in TDD.

Each time you save the current file Watcher will look for a related test through the current project PHPUnit test provider, if it comes across the test it will attempt to automatically run the whole test file.

Results show up in the Test Results panel which enables you to keep an eye on your tests as you make changes.
